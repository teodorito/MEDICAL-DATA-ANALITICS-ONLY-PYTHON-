File in Jupyter Lab (Python only) where raw patient data from a hospital is analyzed. The following techniques and methods were used:

Data Replacement
Loops
Data Splitting: Split the data into individual records using the split()
List Manipulation: Processed each record by splitting it further with the split() method using a comma , as the delimiter, and stored the resulting lists in a list of lists.
Data Extraction: Extracted specific fields (names, ages, BMIs, and insurance costs) from the processed records using list indexing and appended these values to separate lists.
